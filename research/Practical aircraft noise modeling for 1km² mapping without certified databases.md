# Practical aircraft noise modeling for 1km² mapping without certified databases

Aircraft noise modeling for spatial mapping requires integrating acoustic physics, regulatory metrics, computational methods, and psychoacoustic understanding. This comprehensive analysis addresses each requirement for practical implementation using only flight tracking data.

## Best noise metrics for aircraft assessment

**Day-Night Level (DNL) emerges as the optimal primary metric** for aircraft noise mapping, adopted by the FAA since the 1970s and forming the basis for regulatory compliance worldwide. The DNL formula incorporates a 10 dB penalty for nighttime operations (10:00 PM to 7:00 AM), mathematically expressed as:

```
DNL = 10 × log₁₀[(1/24) × (15 × 10^(Ld/10) + 9 × 10^((Ln+10)/10))]
```

This metric captures both the intensity of individual aircraft events and their cumulative impact over 24 hours. **The 65 dB DNL threshold represents the federal significance level** for residential land use compatibility in the United States, with similar thresholds adopted internationally.

Sound Exposure Level (SEL) serves as the fundamental building block for DNL calculations, normalizing all acoustic energy from a single aircraft event into a one-second equivalent burst. This enables uniform comparison between events of varying duration. Alternative metrics like CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level) add a 4.77 dB evening penalty, while the European Lden includes a 5 dB evening penalty, but all share the same energy-averaging principle where a 3 dB increase represents a doubling of acoustic energy.

The superiority of these metrics for aircraft noise stems from their ability to account for **temporal patterns unique to aviation** - intermittent high-intensity events rather than continuous exposure, increased sensitivity during sleep hours, and the correlation between cumulative exposure and community annoyance established through decades of dose-response research.

## Propagation models without ground measurements

The most practical approach combines simplified physics-based models with empirical relationships. **The core propagation equation** incorporates multiple attenuation mechanisms:

```
Total_Attenuation = A_div + A_atm + A_gr + A_lat
```

**Spherical spreading (A_div)** provides the primary attenuation mechanism, following the inverse square law with 6 dB reduction per doubling of distance. This fundamental relationship requires no calibration and applies universally to point sources in free field conditions.

**Atmospheric absorption (A_atm)** varies with frequency, temperature, and humidity. For practical implementation, simplified coefficients from ISO 9613-1 provide adequate accuracy: approximately 0.5 dB/km at low frequencies increasing to 2-4 dB/km above 2 kHz. Standard atmospheric conditions (15°C, 70% humidity) serve as reasonable defaults when meteorological data is unavailable.

The **Noise-Power-Distance (NPD) approach** offers a pragmatic solution for source noise estimation without certified data. NPD curves relate Sound Exposure Level to engine thrust and distance through empirical relationships:

```
SEL = A + B × log₁₀(Thrust) + C × log₁₀(Distance)
```

Where coefficients A, B, and C vary by aircraft type but can be approximated using generic categories (heavy jets, medium jets, light aircraft, turboprops). The EUROCONTROL Aircraft Noise and Performance database provides publicly available NPD curves for common aircraft types that can serve as default values.

## Calculating noise from flight parameters

**Engine thrust estimation** represents the critical link between flight tracking data and noise generation. Climb rate provides the most reliable indicator of thrust setting through the relationship:

```
Thrust ≈ Weight × (sin(γ) + CD/CL)
```

Where γ represents the climb angle derived from vertical rate and ground speed. For typical operations, takeoff thrust corresponds to maximum rated thrust, climb thrust reduces to approximately 85-90%, and approach thrust varies between 30-50% depending on configuration.

**The CHOICE Python library** (GitHub: emthm/CHOICE) implements these relationships comprehensively, requiring only basic aircraft parameters like mass, wing area, and engine count. It predicts noise at both source and ground reception points using semi-empirical methods validated against real measurements.

For simplified implementation, **rule-of-thumb calculations** provide reasonable estimates:
- Heavy jets (>136,000 kg): Baseline + 6-10 dB
- Medium jets: Baseline reference
- Light aircraft (<5,700 kg): Baseline - 10 to 15 dB
- Add 3 dB per doubling of engines

Flight phase significantly impacts noise radius. Takeoff operations generate the highest noise levels (130-140 dB at source) with ground-level impacts of 90-100 dB at typical residential distances. The noise radius for 65 dB DNL exposure typically extends 2-5 km from runway ends for jet aircraft, reducing to 1-2 km for general aviation aircraft.

## Aircraft-specific noise characteristics

**Turbofan engines** dominate modern commercial aviation, with high bypass ratios (up to 12:1) providing 95% reduction in sound power compared to early turbojets. Noise sources include fan noise (dominant at takeoff), jet mixing noise (aft radiation), and buzz-saw noise when fan tips reach supersonic speeds. Modern aircraft like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 achieve certified noise levels around 90 dB through advanced acoustic treatments and ultra-high bypass engines.

**Propeller aircraft** generate distinctive tonal signatures at the blade passage frequency (BPF = RPM/60 × blade count) and its harmonics. A typical Cessna 172 operating at 2400 RPM with a two-blade propeller produces a fundamental frequency of 80 Hz with strong harmonics extending to 1-2 kHz. These tonal characteristics explain why propeller aircraft often seem louder than their absolute sound levels suggest - the discrete frequencies are more noticeable and annoying than broadband jet noise.

**Helicopters** present unique challenges due to **blade-vortex interaction (BVI)**, creating the characteristic "wop-wop" sound during descent and maneuvering. Main rotor noise dominates at low frequencies (20-200 Hz) while tail rotor noise extends to higher frequencies matching peak human hearing sensitivity. Typical noise levels reach 90-100+ dB during normal operations, exceeding 100 dB during BVI conditions.

Flight phase dramatically affects noise generation. **Takeoff represents maximum community impact** due to full power settings at low altitude. During climb, thrust reduction (typically at 1500 feet AGL) provides noise relief. Approach operations generate significant noise from aerodynamic sources - extended flaps and landing gear can contribute 5-10 dB to total aircraft noise.

## Aviation authority noise mapping methods

The **FAA's Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT)** represents the current standard, replacing the legacy Integrated Noise Model. AEDT implements comprehensive physics-based propagation including atmospheric effects, ground reflections, and lateral attenuation. The tool processes annual average operations to generate DNL contours at 5 dB intervals, typically focusing on the 55-75 dB range for land use planning.

**European authorities** follow Commission Directive 2015/996 establishing common noise assessment methods. The CNOSSOS-EU framework mandates Lden and Lnight metrics with strategic noise mapping for airports exceeding 50,000 movements annually. Calculation methods explicitly account for meteorological conditions, with separate propagation paths for favorable and homogeneous conditions.

All major authorities employ **grid-based calculations** with receivers distributed across the study area. Standard practice uses 100-meter grid spacing for regional studies, refined to 25-50 meters near noise-sensitive locations. Population exposure assessment overlays demographic data with noise contours to quantify impacts.

## Atmospheric effects on propagation

**Temperature gradients** create acoustic refraction, bending sound rays and creating shadow zones or enhanced propagation regions. The effective sound speed varies with height according to:

```
c_eff = c₀ × √(1 + T_gradient × h / T₀)
```

Typical lapse rates (-6.5°C/km) cause upward refraction, reducing noise levels at distant receivers. Temperature inversions reverse this effect, trapping sound near the surface and extending noise impacts.

**Wind gradients** modify propagation asymmetrically, with downwind enhancement and upwind reduction. The effective sound speed incorporates wind velocity:

```
c_eff = c + v_wind × cos(φ)
```

Where φ represents the angle between wind and propagation directions. Typical wind gradient effects produce 5-10 dB variations between upwind and downwind locations at distances exceeding 1 km.

**Humidity primarily affects high-frequency attenuation** through molecular absorption. Low humidity (< 20%) dramatically increases absorption above 2 kHz, while very high humidity (> 80%) minimizes frequency-dependent effects. Standard conditions (15°C, 70% RH) provide reasonable defaults for annual average calculations.

## Computational approaches for 24-hour mapping

**Energy averaging forms the mathematical foundation** for cumulative metrics. The DNL calculation requires logarithmic summation of individual events:

```
DNL = 10 × log₁₀ [Σ(day_events × 10^(SEL/10))/T_day + 
                    10 × Σ(night_events × 10^(SEL/10))/T_night]
```

Where T_day and T_night represent the duration of day and night periods in seconds.

**Grid-based computation** typically employs 100m × 100m cells for 1 km² areas, creating 100 calculation points. Each point receives contributions from all flight operations, with propagation calculations determining individual SEL values. **Inverse distance weighting** provides efficient spatial interpolation between calculated points:

```
Z(s₀) = Σ[w_i × Z(s_i)] where w_i = 1/d^p
```

Modern implementations leverage **parallel processing** to handle millions of source-receiver pairs efficiently. The NoiseModelling open-source platform demonstrates practical implementation using H2GIS spatial database integration, achieving processing times of 1-10 minutes per airport-day on standard hardware.

## Why small aircraft seem louder than absolute levels

**Psychoacoustic factors explain the disproportionate annoyance** from small aircraft despite lower absolute sound levels. Propeller aircraft generate strong tonal components at blade passage frequencies, typically 100-400 Hz with harmonics extending through the most sensitive range of human hearing (1-4 kHz). These discrete frequency peaks activate different neural processing than broadband jet noise, increasing perceived loudness and annoyance.

**Temporal characteristics amplify the impact.** Small aircraft produce continuous drone lasting 30-60 seconds versus brief 10-20 second jet encounters. The amplitude modulation from rotating propellers creates roughness (temporal variations at 20-300 Hz) that significantly increases annoyance. Helicopters compound this with distinctive impulsive blade-vortex interactions.

**Lower operational altitudes reduce atmospheric attenuation** and increase angular subtense, making aircraft appear larger and closer. Rural environments lack the ambient noise masking present in urban areas - typical rural backgrounds of 35-45 dBA provide minimal masking of aircraft noise, while urban environments (55-65 dBA) partially conceal low-frequency components.

The **tonality penalty in psychoacoustic models** quantifies this effect. The Zwicker model calculates perceived annoyance as:

```
PA = N × (1 + √(S² + T²))
```

Where N represents loudness in sones, S is sharpness, and T is tonality. Small aircraft score significantly higher on both sharpness and tonality metrics, explaining why 50 propeller aircraft events can generate more complaints than 200 jet operations at similar SEL levels.

## Practical implementation recommendations

For implementation without certified databases, the **CHOICE Python library** provides the most comprehensive solution, requiring only basic aircraft parameters obtainable from ADS-B data. Combined with **OpenSky Network** for flight tracking (providing position, altitude, speed, and climb rate at 5-second intervals), this enables functional noise modeling.

The recommended workflow processes flight data to identify aircraft types, detect flight phases from trajectory analysis, estimate thrust from climb performance, and apply NPD relationships for noise calculation. Grid-based receivers at 100m spacing provide adequate resolution for planning applications, with propagation calculations incorporating standard atmospheric conditions.

Validation should compare predictions against any available noise monitor data, expecting ±5-7 dB accuracy for mixed operations. Published airport noise contours provide additional validation references. For regulatory applications, conservative assumptions and clear uncertainty bounds ensure appropriate interpretation of results.

This practical framework enables cost-effective noise assessment for airport planning, environmental impact analysis, and community engagement while acknowledging the inherent limitations of simplified models compared to certified tools.
